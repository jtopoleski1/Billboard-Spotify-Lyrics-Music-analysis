# Bop to the Top: What Makes a Hit?
What makes a song a #1 hit?

## Summary
How have the top 100 songs changed over time? This is a fascinating question becasue the music industry over the past 20 years has been revolutionized through the use of technology. Music sharing platforms have increased in size and number, and [more and more people are streaming music than ever before](https://www.recordingconnection.com/reference-library/recording-entrepreneurs/how-the-internet-changed-music/). This project takes a deeper look at exactly how this shift has changed the Billboard top charts, through graphic statistical analysis. Take a look [here](https://jtopoleski.shinyapps.io/What-Makes-a-Hit-Song/). 

I first explore title length, song duration, and genre information. I then explore these same factors, differentiating between number one songs, top ten songs, top 25 songs, and songs that never escaped the 26-100 range. I also allow an analysis based upon year (2000-2017).Finally, I will break down components of the actual music and lyrics, such as tempo, danceability, and liveness, to see how our favorite songs have changed over time and if there is a differentiatiation between what makes a song that holds the #1 spot.

## Data Source
The [data](https://github.com/taubergm/Billboard-Spotify-Lyrics-Music-analysis) used in this project was scraped from the Billboard Hot 100 website by Michael Tauberg. It was then cleaned and turned in to a manipulatable form of data for users to work with.

## Conclusions
After statistically analyzing the various factors of a song, I give suggestions on how to maximize chances of a top hit. My reccomendations include: a r&b, rap, or pop song; a song with a short title (only 12-13 characters in length), a song that ranges 3:30-4:00 minutes in length; a song with a high level of "danceability", a measurement of how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.


The following project was created by Jordan Topoleski as a Harvard University [Gov 1005: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005_fall_2018.pdf) final project, under the guidance of Preceptor David Kane.
