# Bop-to-the-Top-What-Makes-a-Hit
What makes a song a #1 hit?

# Summary
How have the top 100 songs changed over time? I first explore title length, song duration, and genre information. I then explore these same factors, differentiating between number one songs, top ten songs, top 25 songs, and songs that never escaped the 26-100 range. I also allow an analysis based upon year (2000-2017).Finally, I will break down components of the actual music and lyrics, such as tempo, danceability, and liveness, to see how our favorite songs have changed over time and if there is a differentiatiation between what makes a song that holds the #1 spot.
