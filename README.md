Scripts to get musical data on billboard-hot100 songs from spotify

What makes a song a #1 hit?

How have the top 100 songs changed over time?I first explore title length, song duration, and genre information. I then explore these same factors, differentiating between number one songs, top ten songs, and songs that never escaped the 11-100 range. I will also use sentiment analysis to see how words to our favorite songs have changed over time and if they differentiate with songs that make that #1 spot.
